I am a PhD student at the NeuRonICS lab at the Indian Institute of Science, Banglore, co-supervised by [Dr. Chetan Singh Thakur](https://labs.dese.iisc.ac.in/neuronics/people/) and [Prof Andr√© van Schaik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ud0G048AAAAJ&hl=en).  My research areas include Neuromorphic computing, IC Designs, and Deep learning. As a part of my research, I am working on the development of neuromorphic attention hardware.
